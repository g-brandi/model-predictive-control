# Model Predictive Control Lab Activities
This repository contains the lab activities from the Model Predictive Control course as part of the Master's Degree program in Automation Engineering at Polytechnic University of Bari. The labs cover various aspects of linear and nonlinear constrained Model Predictive Control (MPC), providing hands-on experience in designing and implementing innovative control strategies in MATLAB.

## Overview
Each lab focuses on a different aspect of the Model Predictive Control, ranging from fundamental concepts such as linear MPC and tuning techniques to advanced topics including non linear MPC and contstraints handling. The several examples provide a deeper understanding of the Model Predictive Control theory and its application in real-world control scenarios. The labs are arranged as follows:
- **2023-10-09.** Introduction to the linear Model Predictive Control in MATLAB, with an example on the control of a spring-mass system.
- **2023-10-16.** Tuning of the controller using MPC Designer toolbox in MATLAB, with an example on the automatic cruise control of a vehicle.
- **2023-10-23.** Definition of constraints using the properties of the `mpc()` object and the MPC Designer toolbox, revisiting the spring-mass system example.
- **2023-10-30.** Recap of previous topics and demonstration of the control of a paper machine.
- **2023-11-13.** Recap of previous topics and demonstration of the control of a 2-DOF helicopter, including dynamic reference tracking.
- **2023-11-20.** Introduction to the non linear Model Predictive Control in MATLAB, with an example on the trajectory planning and control of a differential drive vehicle.
- **2023-12-11.** Recap of previous topics, analysis of cost and computational time and demonstration of the control of a truck and trailer vehicle.
- **2023-12-18.** Recap of previous topics and demonstration of the control of a Falcon 9 rocket.
